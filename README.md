compose_addressbook
===================

compose_addressbook plugin adds a button to the compose screen allowing you to select contacts with the mouse. These contacts can then be added to your recipients (To/CC/BCC) with a mouse click. This plugin does not work with the larry skin, as it already has an addressbook in the compose area. Only use with the classic skin.
